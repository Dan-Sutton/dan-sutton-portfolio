      "With the creation of this app, I aimed to solve the daily issue of what to have at meal times. I was inspired by the quick and simple useage of Tinder, which gives the user a quick overview of information, allowing them to quickly decide 'yes', or 'no'. My learning focus here was to practise fetching information from a API. ",

      "I created this app with the purpose of solving an issue that I run into as a live musician. People sometimes interrupt me mid-set to make song requests. I thought that I could create a platform that would allow users to make song requests to someone that they are watching. My main learning object was to understand how to use Firebase authentication and Firestore. An artist can sign up using their Google account, and create a unique ‘request code’, that audience members can reference when making their requests. This request code can be updated when needed. Audience members currently don’t have to log in, but instead are required to input the request code given to them from an artist, and input request details. This is then submitted to Firestore, and linked to that artist’s own store. The artist is also able to achieve all CRUD operations.",
